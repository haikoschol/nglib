nglib is a simple application that puts PDF and CHM files in a directory
hierarchy into a SQLite database for faster searching. Originally the plan
was to extract metadata like title and author from these files, but this turned
out to be not as straight-forward as expected. So for now, only filenames
are used. Titles are generated from filenames by stripping the file extension
and replacing "." with spaces.

Make sure you have the python bindings for the STFL[1] library installed
(python-stfl on Debian/Ubuntu).

On first run, the program will ask you for some configuration settings:

- the directory where you store your PDF and CHM collection
- a command that should be used for displaying PDF files
- a command that should be used for displaying CHM files

Those settings will be written to ~/.nglib/nglibrc
